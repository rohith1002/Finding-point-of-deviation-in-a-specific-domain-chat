# Finding-point-of-deviation-in-a-specific-domain-chat

This project involves the development of an enhanced chat application that employs the SentenceBERT model for computing cosine scores, enabling the prediction of message relevance. It also incorporates a dynamic threshold mechanism based on past messages. The system consists of two servers: a stationary server responsible for delivering HTML/CSS/JS components for the chat application, and a Flask server handling incoming messages.

## Features

- Real-time chat application with enhanced message relevance prediction.
- Integration of SentenceBERT for calculating cosine similarity scores between messages.
- Implementation of a dynamic threshold mechanism using past k messages for relevance prediction.

## Technologies Used

- Sentence-BERT: For computing cosine similarity scores.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For creating the user interface of the chat application.
- Flask: To build the server that handles incoming messages.
- Other libraries/packages: List any additional libraries or packages used.
